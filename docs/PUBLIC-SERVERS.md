# About Public Servers
Members of the Sparkyfish community have kindly made available some public Sparkyfish servers for your testing.
Most of these servers are running on public cloud instances and have ~100-200 Mbit/s up/down capacity so they may
not be suitable for testing your machine if you have a connection that's faster than that.

# Current Public Servers
The easiest way to use a public server is to use the round-robin hostname/port:  ```us.sparkyfish.chrissnell.com:7121```.

| Hostname | Location | Sponsor| ISP| Link Capacity | Protocol |

| us-seattle.sparkyfish.chrissnell.com:7121| Seattle, WA | [Nigel VH](https://www.blueboxcloud.comBox | 150 Mbps up/down| IPv4 + IPv6 |
